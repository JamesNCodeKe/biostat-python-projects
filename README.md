# James Njoroge's Biostatistics & Bioinformatics Portfolio

This repository contains Python projects and scripts I developed as part of my BSc in Biochemistry studies at Egerton University. The goal is to demonstrate my ability to apply computational thinking and data analysis to solve biological problems.

## 🔬 Projects

Here are the projects you can find in this repository:

### 1. Biostatistics Fundamentals
* **File:** `biostatistics_basics.py`
* **Purpose:** A script that calculates fundamental statistics from a list of numbers.
* **Skills Demonstrated:**
    * Python function definition (`def`)
    * Calculating mean, median, variance, and standard deviation from scratch.
    * Looping (`for`), conditionals (`if/else`), and list sorting.

### 2. [Your Next Project Title - e.g., Enzyme Kinetics Plotter]
* **File:** `[your_file_name.py]`
* **Purpose:** [Explain what this project does in one sentence. e.g., "A script that uses Matplotlib to plot data from a biochemistry lab report."]
* **Skills Demonstrated:**
    * [e.g., Data visualization with `matplotlib`]
    * [e.g., File I/O (reading data from a file)]
    * [e.g., Using the `pandas` library]

### 3. [Your Next Project Title - e.g., Rosalind Problem Solvers]
* **File:** `[your_file_name.py]`
* **Purpose:** [e.g., "My solution for the Rosalind 'Counting Point Mutations' (HAMM) problem."]
* **Skills Demonstrated:**
    * [e.g., Algorithmic thinking]
    * [e.g., String manipulation]
    * [e.g., FASTA file parsing]
